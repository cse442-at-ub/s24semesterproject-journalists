Setting Up and Running a React Application with Vite in Visual Studio Code


This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough for creating a React application using Vite and setting it up in Visual Studio Code. It is designed for compatibility with Node.js (version 14.x or newer) and npm (version 6.x or newer).


Introduction to Vite and React
React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. Vite is a modern, fast build tool that significantly improves the development experience by offering out-of-the-box support for features like hot module replacement (HMR). Choosing Vite for a React project can lead to faster development cycles, thanks to its efficient handling of modules.


Prerequisites
1. Visual Studio Code (1.55 or newer recommended)
2. Node.js (LTS version recommended)
* npm (comes with Node.js)
Installation Steps


Step 1: Install Node.js and npm


Download Node.js: Visit Node.js LTS Version to download the LTS version.
Install Node.js and npm: Execute the downloaded installer and follow the prompts. Ensure npm is included and Node.js is added to your PATH.
Verify Installation: Open a terminal and run node -v and npm -v to check installations.


Step 2: Install Visual Studio Code


Download: Visit Visual Studio Code and download the installer for your OS.
Install: Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions, including adding VS Code to the path.


Step 3: Create and Setup Your React Project


Open a Terminal: Use your system's terminal or Command Prompt/PowerShell.
Create a Vite React Project: Run npm create vite@latest my-react-project -- --template react. Replace my-react-project with your desired project name.
Navigate to Project Directory: Use cd my-react-project to enter your project folder.
Install Dependencies: Run npm install to install required dependencies.


Step 4: Open the Project in Visual Studio Code


Open VS Code: Run code . in your project directory. If this doesn't work, manually open VS Code and navigate to your project folder.
Step 5: Start the Development Server


Start Server: In VS Code, open a terminal and execute npm run dev. This starts the Vite development server.


Step 6: View Your Application


Open a Browser: Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see your React application live.

Troubleshooting


If you encounter issues with npm commands, verify your Node.js and npm installations, and consider using nvm (Node Version Manager) for managing Node.js versions.
Should the code command not open VS Code, ensure VS Code's command line tools are properly installed or open the project manually.
